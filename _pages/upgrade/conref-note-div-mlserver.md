If you are upgrading both DHF and MarkLogic, you can upgrade them independently of each other as long as you are running a version of MarkLogic Server that is compatible with the DHF version you plan to install. (See [Version Compatibility]({{site.baseurl}}/refs/version-compatibility/).) If you are running an older version of MarkLogic Server, then you must upgrade MarkLogic Server before upgrading DHF.
